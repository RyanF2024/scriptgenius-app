# Design System

Welcome to the ScriptIQ Design System! This is a comprehensive collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build applications with consistent design and user experience.

## Getting Started

To use a component in your project, import it from the `@/components/ui` directory:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { Input } from '@/components/ui/input';
import { Card } from '@/components/ui/card';
```

## Design Principles

1. **Consistency**: Components follow a consistent design language and behavior.
2. **Accessibility**: All components are built with accessibility in mind.
3. **Composable**: Components can be combined in various ways to create complex UIs.
4. **Customizable**: Components are built to be flexible and customizable.

## Available Components

- **Button**: Interactive elements that trigger actions.
- **Input**: Form controls for text input.
- **Card**: Container for displaying content and actions about a single subject.
